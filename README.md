# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED : 

1. Current Weather Display
Location retrieval: Utilizes the browser’s Geolocation API to detect the user's current position and automatically fetch weather data for that location.

Manual search: Users can enter a city name or region in a search bar to fetch weather data for a different location.

Key metrics: Displays temperature (in Celsius/Fahrenheit), weather description (e.g., “Cloudy”, “Thunderstorms”), humidity, wind speed/direction, atmospheric pressure, sunrise/sunset times, and possibly “feels‑like” temperature and visibility.

2. Forecast Functionality
Hourly forecast: Shows short‑term weather predictions for the next 48 hours (often in 3‑hour increments), helpful for planning the day.

Daily forecast: Provides a multi‑day forecast (typically 5 to 7 days), including daily high/low temperatures, general weather conditions, and perhaps precipitation chance.

3. User Experience Enhancements
Dynamic background/images: The UI adapts—e.g., shows a sunny background when it’s sunny, rain animations when it’s raining.

Responsive design: The layout adjusts seamlessly across devices—desktop browsers, tablets, or mobile phones.

Clear layout: Weather metrics are clearly laid out—perhaps with icons representing sun, clouds, rain, wind, etc. Forecasts are often shown in card or list format.

4. API Integration
The app communicates with a weather API using HTTP fetch calls. It handles:

Success & error statuses: Displays data when successful, shows error messages (“Location not found”, “API limit reached”) otherwise.

Data parsing: Extracts relevant fields such as temperature, humidity, icon codes, forecast arrays, then maps them to UI components.

5. Code Structure & Practices
Modular code: Likely organized with separate files for core utilities (API fetch functions), UI components, and state/DOM updates.

Version control: The repo probably includes .gitignore, package.json, and other standard files.

Documentation: A README explaining setup, installation steps, environment variables (for storing the API key), and basic usage.
